### Run it

To run the application locally, you have to start both server and frontend application:
1. Navigate to the `api` folder in the terminal and start the server: `yarn start`
2. (Open `localhost:4000` in the browser to test the GraphQL API)
3. In a different terminal navigate to the `frontend` folder (or however you called it) and run it as well.
